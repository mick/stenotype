Stenotype  -- listen to a phone call, transcribe and send the transcription to a xmpp multi-user chat

Dependencies: Python Twisted, twilio account

Install: Download, edit stenotype.tac with xmpp config, stenotype.py with twilio config, and run with twisted


You can also use the dialer.py script to run some twilio commands.

./dialer.py [connect <number> | hangup]

hangup will disconnect all calls on the twilio account.


The name Stenotype comes from the device used by court reporters  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype 



You need to host the CALL XML somewhere yourself, it defines the call back url, which should be the domain + port of the twistd server.

XMPP config needed all in the TAC file.
